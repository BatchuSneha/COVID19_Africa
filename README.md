#Regression group project on Covid19 in Africa

COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 260M cases reported, resulting in 5.2M deaths. COVID has impacted the world’s most developed economies by stifling trade, travel, GDP, and a host of other economic indicators. Africa is the world’s poorest continent as defined by people living in poverty, and therefore includes a population that is vulnerable to the spread of infectious disease. Africa is also the continent with the least amount of vaccinated individuals. Therefore, we collected and analyzed data on COVID-19 deaths for each country in Africa, and have chosen variables we believe to be indicators in driving deaths.

According to this analysis, we can conclude that AIDI, HEPC, logPop, mandatory schooling years, and corruption score have a positive causal effect on COVID deaths (or fatality rates) in Africa. Age65, and popDensity have a negative causal effect on COVID deaths (or fatality rates) in Africa, contrary to what we’ve been told through modern science and news. However, a country’s percentage of population that has diabetes or has access to handwashing facilities does not seem to have a causal effect on COVID deaths in Africa, which is again, contradictory to what has been indicated by general science, which might be due to under counting of COVID-19 deaths by country.
